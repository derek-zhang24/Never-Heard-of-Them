# Never-Heard-of-Them
A web project I did for a class project to find an artist's profile which contains the artist's upcoming shows and a playlist of their music on Spotify if available.
Each of the files were used in the web service which can be found at https://goo.gl/7joABu. All of the files were written by me except for the spotify-en-tools.js which was a public file provided by Spotify themselves.
